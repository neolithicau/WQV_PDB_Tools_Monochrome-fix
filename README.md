# WQV_PDB_Tools 0.1
Written by nnnn2cat

 Extracts image data from .pdb files generated by WQV Link for Palm OS.

 I forked this flavour to make my fixes to the WQV_Monochrome component widely available. I was encountering PIL image processing errors on my WQVLinkPDB.db file containing images downloaded from a Casio WQV-1. The data offset appeared to be incorrect.
 
 This re-do is tested and working for me on Windows with Python 3.12 and PIL. Your mileage may vary. I was also experimenting with decoding the metadata but I may or may not return to this in the future.
 
 This version outputs PNG files.

==========================
1. Extract this archive somewhere. 

2. Install Python if you don't have it already. This fork was tested with Python 3.12.

3. Transfer images from your watch to your PDA using WQV Link for Palm OS Handhelds Ver. 1.1.

4. Hotsync your PDA to your computer. This should generate a backup of your WQV Link data.

5. Navigate to your WQV Link Backup data in your Hotsync folder.
   In my case, this was:
   Documents/Palm OS Desktop/[username]/Backup/WQVLinkDB.PDB

6. Copy WQVLinkDB.PDB to the 'pdb' folder of this tool.

7. Run convert.bat.

8. If everything succeeded, you should now have extracted PNGs in the 'out' folder.

9. Enjoy your new photos.
